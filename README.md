#RMUploadKit SDK

This SDK is designed to easily allow developers to create plugins to expand Courier's list of supported services.

It is super easy to get up and running:

* Download one of the distributions from the downloads section 
* Install the SDK using the installer
* Create a new project in Xcode using the `RMUploadKit Plugin` project template

##Notes

* If you decide you don't want to use our project template (we recommend you do) you will need to set the `Additional SDKs` build flag to `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/SDKs/RMUploadKit.sdk`

##TODO

* Move the guide from the .pages format into something nice like Markdown
* Write an uninstall script and document its behaviour
