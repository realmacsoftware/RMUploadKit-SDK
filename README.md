#RMUploadKit SDK

This SDK is designed to easily allow developers to create plugins to expand Courier's list of supported services.

It is super easy to get up and running:

* Download one the prebuilt SDK from [https://github.com/downloads/realmacsoftware/RMUploadKit-SDK/RMUploadKit%20SDK.zip](https://github.com/downloads/realmacsoftware/RMUploadKit-SDK/RMUploadKit%20SDK.zip)
* Install the SDK using the included installer
* Create a new project in Xcode using the `RMUploadKit Plugin` project template

##Documentation

View the hosted documentation here [http://realmacsoftware.github.com/RMUploadKit-SDK/](http://realmacsoftware.github.com/RMUploadKit-SDK/)

Documentation is generated from the header files using doxygen and doxyclean.

##Notes

* If you decide you don't want to use our project template (we recommend you do) you will need to set the `Additional SDKs` build flag to `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/SDKs/RMUploadKit.sdk`

##Todo

* Write an uninstall script and document its behaviour
